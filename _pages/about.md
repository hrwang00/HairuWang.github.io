# üëã About Me

Hi, everyone! I earned my bachelor‚Äôs degree at Harbin Institute of Technology in 2023. In the same year, I joined the School of Computer Science at USTC for my master's degree. Currently, I am a third-year M.S. candidate jointly supervised by Prof. [Prof. Xike Xie](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xkxie/) and [Prof. S. Kevin Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8eNm2GMAAAAJ&hl=en).

Please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out for any discussion. You can contact me via Email: hrwang00@mail dot ustc dot edu dot cn. I am always open to engaging in intriguing research endeavors! üòä

# üìù Research Interests:

My research interests include NNs' memory, Large Language Models, LLM efficiency, and RAG.

üéØ **Teaching NNs to memorize data streams & Learnable Large-Scale Data Compression.**

1. <span style="color:#002FA7;">**[ICLR 2024 Spotlight]**</span>  Mayfly: a Neural Data Structure for Graph Stream Summarization. <span>   [link](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=n7Sr8SW4bn)</span>
2. <span style="color:#002FA7;">**[TPAMI24]**</span>  Learning to Sketch: A Neural Approach to Item Frequency Estimation in Streaming Data. <span> [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10499867/) </span>
3. <span style="color:#002FA7;">**[ICML 2025]**</span>  Lego Sketch: A Scalable Memory-augmented Neural Network for Sketching Data Streams. <span> [link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=GPSmbdTZBm) </span>

üéØ **LLM Efficiency.**

1. <span style="color:#002FA7;">**[EMNLP 2024 Main]**</span> Pruning via Merging: Compressing LLMs via Manifold Alignment Based Layer Merging.  [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16330)
2. <span style="color:#002FA7;">**[EMNLP 2025 findings]**</span> SkewRoute: Training-Free LLM Routing for Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Score Skewness.  [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23841)
    *We propose the first LLM routing method for KG-RAG, based on the observation of a strong correlation between query difficulty and the skewness of the RAG retrieval score distribution.*

üéØ **RAG in LLMs.**


1. <span style="color:#002FA7;">**[ACL 2025 findings]**</span> FRAG: A Flexible Modular Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation based on Knowledge Graphs <span> [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09957)</span>
